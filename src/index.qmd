## About the workshop

This workshop focuses on the Quarto scientific and technical publishing system.

With Quarto, you can produce websites or blogs, dashboards, scientific articles, presentations, and books that combine text, figures, and code, and can be rendered into a variety of output formats.
With Quarto, you can do a number of things that seem like magic tricks to scholars used to more traditional ways of working.

The workshop is open to anyone who wants to embrace more reproducible practices into their scholarly workflows.

The philosophy is "[Don't Repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself): Write it Down" or the more easily remembered "DRY WIT."
We didn't invent this philosophy [@Thomas2019-eq; @Econometrics2023-ow], nor do we promote it slavishly.
There are exceptions to every rule.
But like all aphorisms, it helps us remember; and the principles are extremely useful and often save time.
Who has time to waste, after all?
