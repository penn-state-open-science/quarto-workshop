[Rick Gilmore](https://psych.la.psu.edu/people/rog1_/) is Professor of [Psychology at Penn State](https://la.psu.edu/). 
He is the co-founder and co-director of the [Databrary.org ](https://databrary.org) data library.
In addition to his research on the development of vision in infants, children, and emerging adults, Gilmore is an advocate for open, transparent, reproducible, and robust research practices.
He uses Quarto (and its predecessor, R Markdown) for [personal](https://rick-gilmore.com) and [professional](https://gilmore-lab.github.io) websites and [blogs](https://w3tm.org), research [reports](https://penn-state-open-science.github.io/survey-fall-2022/), and [course](https://psu-psychology.github.io/psych-490-reproducibility-2023-fall/) materials.

<!-- [Alaina Pearce](https://sites.psu.edu/alainapearce/) is Assistant Research Professor in the [Department of Nutritional Sciences](https://hhd.psu.edu/nutrition) and [Center for Childhood Obesity Research](https://hhd.psu.edu/ccor) and is an affiliate of the [Institute of Computational and Data Sciences](https://www.icds.psu.edu). Dr. Pearce is a cognitive neuroscientist and her research interests center on understanding on the reciprocal association between neurocognitive functioning and pediatric obesity. Dr. Pearce’s current research aims to: 1) characterize cognitive function, neural food-cue responsivity, and eating behaviors in children at high and low familial risk for obesity prior to the development of excess adiposity; 2) identify neurocognitive processes and eating behaviors that confer either risk or resiliency to pediatric obesity; and 3) characterize child eating behaviors through meal microstructure and computational modeling. -->

<!-- Bari Fuchs recently received her Ph.D. in Nutritional Sciences at Penn State, where she studied neural and decision-making correlates of pediatric eating behaviors. She has 10 years of experience managing and processing multi-modal data (survey, behavioral, neuroimaging) for research studies. Dr. Fuchs places a strong emphasis on transparency and reproducibility in her data management approach. She achieves this by developing software to clean and organize data, implementing field-standardized data organization structures, and sharing data and code on public repositories. -->
