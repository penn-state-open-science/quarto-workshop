    "text": "About the workshop\nThis workshop focuses on the Quarto scientific and technical publishing system.\nWith Quarto, you can produce websites or blogs, dashboards, scientific articles, presentations, and books that combine text, figures, and code, and can be rendered into a variety of output formats. With Quarto, you can do a number of things that seem like magic tricks to scholars used to more traditional ways of working.\nThe workshop is open to anyone who wants to embrace more reproducible practices into their scholarly workflows.\nThe philosophy is “Don’t Repeat Yourself: Write it Down” or the more easily remembered “DRY WIT.”\n\n\n\ndrywit.com\n\n\nRick Gilmore, John Thomas will lead the workshop.\nMore details about the schedule and the faculty can be found by following the links."
